Instructions for how to set up everything so that I don't forget

1) The ecg_output.csv file contains all of the results that the ML model should be returning = "the answer sheet"

2) Single_patient... .csv is a file that contains all 12 ECG signals for a single patient. There are over 800 patients ECGs in the
		above file
		
3) In order to extract a single patient file that allows you to plot the signals do the following
	1) Take 'ecg_tracings.hdf5' and convert it to 3d numpy array
		>>> import numpy as np
		>>> import h5py
		>>> with h5py.File('/home/fran1099/Downloads/data/ecg_tracings.hdf5', "r") as f:
...     	>>>	x = np.array(f['tracings'])

		---The result array is a 3d array. x[0] = patient zero; x[1] = patient one; etc...
		
		****It would make things a lot easier if we cna find a way to store a file a 3d numpy array so that we don't
		have to keep running the above commands*****
		
		
		
	2) Take each individual patient (ie: x[0], x[1], etc...) and turn it into a csv file
		>>> import pandas as pd
		>>> pd.DataFrame(x[0]).to_csv('filename.csv')

	3) Create the charts for the signals
		1) Easy enough just use basic excel/libreoffice knowledge 
		2) Now I try matlab
		
		
		a = readtable('/home/fran1099/Desktop/patient544.csv');
		stackedplot(a(2:end,2:end))
